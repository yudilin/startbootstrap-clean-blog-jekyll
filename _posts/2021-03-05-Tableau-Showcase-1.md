# Tableau Dashboard Showcase 1: *Price Variation Monitor*

## Background

After adapting to the new normal lifestyle, online shopping has become a dominant distribution method. With more retailers deploying their visual stores, online shoppers will spend extra effort to compare prices and product range. Retailers must monitor their competitors' moves and act correspondently.   

## Key Feature
This dashboard focuses on three key matrixes: regular prices, promotion prices and the price index.
